**11/11/2020** Big update to Ombi today, Ombi is now running the latest .net 5! You will probably not see much difference, but it's a nice upgrade from a development point of view üòÅ

**05/11/2020** Some Lidarr fixes incoming, completly forgot there was no way to mark an album as available manually, you now can from the requests grid! Also let me know what you think about the user profile in the navbar!

**04/11/2020** There is now a small user profile section on the navbar! To get your image appearing we use Gravatar and the email address associated with your user account!

**03/11/2020** For all those complaining about TheMovieDb page not working in V4! Well it does now! Enjoy üòÉ

**27/10/2020** Just a quick update, apologies as of late that the development of Ombi V4 has slowed down a bit. Unfortunatly I have been dealing with some issues outside of Ombi for the past few months, the project is no where near dead, but things are just not progressing as much as I'd like.

**26/10/2020** Welcome to the new news section!
