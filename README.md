**15/02/2022** ‚ú® We now have 4K request support for Movies in Ombi.
Yes, this also means that Ombi now supports multiple instances of Radarr, a regular version and a Radarr 4K version!

This is controlled by some new global feature flags (Settings > Configuration > Control Features). Once that is enabled it will enable 4K across the system. This feature flag will be removed when I am happy with it and there are no bugs.

To allow your users to Request 4K content, they need the new 4K Request Movie role!

**01/10/2021** Wow! So there's been a lot of changes in Ombi happening behind the scenes, lots of technical improvements and general stability/bug fixes. A new feature we have added is you can now specify the request limit range (one of the most popular voted features). So you have the option to set Day, Week and Monthly limits! Also keep an eye out at somepoint there will be a new Seasonal area on the discover page for Halloween! 

**29/07/2021** There is now a 'preview' feature, advanced discovery. If you click the filter icon next to the search there's a new button, this is not yet finished but is usable. Going forward i'll be adding more filters for more refined search resutls. Let me know what you think on Discord!

**08/07/2021** There's been some real big improvements around the performance of the Discover page recently (in develop), I hope you see and enjoy it, with all the other nice little features! ü§©

**08/06/2021** So just a small update, there's been a load of fixes happening in the develop branch, the mobile app is continutally being developed, issue can now be reported on the app, managing issues is next, hopefully you are enjoying that new experience ü§é

**07/05/2021** As you might be aware, we have completly rewritten the Ombi Mobile apps, and I have to say, I'm super proud of them! Check them out! 

**25/03/2021** News has been quiet recently! There has been a LOT of work going on in the Ombi camp, I hope you all like the new interface etc! There are many new features now coming to help improve the overall workflow, including moving away from TV Maze and using The Movie DB as our sole data provider! One of those was pushed out today, so when you are an admin and you try and request content, you have the ability to request on behalf of someone and also change the quality and folders before they are sent to your DVR application! Slightly outside of the main development of Ombi, I've been adding UI Automation tests, these should help with the overall quality of the releases and so far has been super useful for finding bugs already! Thanks for reading! üìö

**10/01/2021** So that most requested feature that I mentioned was up next has been completed! Searching will now take you to a result list similar to the discover page (v4.0.952+). That's the top most feature requests done, what's next then? Well mainly making the interface more user friendly and obvious, this includes better responsiveness and mobile compatibility with the addition of minor features. But behind the scenes something pretty cool is happening, you won't find out yet, but maybe I'll be dropping some hints on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Sa7wNWb) soon! Have fun! ü•≥

**06/01/2021** Well, I've knocked off the next largest item from the feature list! We now have movie and show ratings on the detail pages! On top of that as of today we also include what streaming services they are available on! So the next thing that is coming will be the next most requested feature üòÖ

**04/01/2021** Happy new year everyone! So we have some really cool stuff now planned in the coming weeks. But first I have just added the ability for admins to request on behalf of a user! The most upvoted feature on the [Feature Request](https://ombifeatures.featureupvote.com/) site! Just press the Cog/Settings icon on the details page and you will now have that option!

**11/11/2020** Big update to Ombi today, Ombi is now running the latest .net 5! You will probably not see much difference, but it's a nice upgrade from a development point of view üòÅ

**05/11/2020** Some Lidarr fixes incoming, completly forgot there was no way to mark an album as available manually, you now can from the requests grid! Also let me know what you think about the user profile in the navbar!

**04/11/2020** There is now a small user profile section on the navbar! To get your image appearing we use Gravatar and the email address associated with your user account!

**03/11/2020** For all those complaining about TheMovieDb page not working in V4! Well it does now! Enjoy üòÉ

**27/10/2020** Just a quick update, apologies as of late that the development of Ombi V4 has slowed down a bit. Unfortunatly I have been dealing with some issues outside of Ombi for the past few months, the project is no where near dead, but things are just not progressing as much as I'd like.

**26/10/2020** Welcome to the new news section!
